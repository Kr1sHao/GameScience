# GameScience - SpeechEasy

### Overview
**SpeechEasy** is a software and hardware solution designed to help international students alleviate speech anxiety during presentations. The system consists of two components:

1. **Web-based Prompter**: A user-friendly web interface where students can upload their speech scripts. During the presentation, the prompter displays the script and provides real-time visual encouragement when the audience interacts with the system.

2. **Arduino-based Hardware**: The physical component of the system involves buttons placed on desks in the classroom. When students press these buttons, a servo-driven encouragement device is activated. Simultaneously, the speaker receives supportive messages and icons in their web-based prompter.

### Components

#### Arduino Hardware:
- The Arduino script monitors button presses and controls the servo motor to give visual encouragement.
- The servo moves incrementally with each button press, giving the speaker the impression of rising encouragement.
- Once all buttons are pressed, a "reset" occurs, readying the system for the next session.

#### Web Prompter:
- The web application displays the script during presentations.
- Encouragement messages and icons are sent to the screen based on input from the Arduino setup.

### Requirements

#### Hardware:
- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller
- Servo motor
- Push buttons
- Resistors (for the buttons)

#### Software:
- Arduino IDE (for uploading the code to the microcontroller)
- Web browser (for using the prompter interface)

### Installation

#### 1. Hardware Setup:
- Connect the buttons to the Arduino as described in the `Arduino_Codebase.ino` file.
- Attach the servo motor to pin 9 of the Arduino.
- Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

#### 2. Web Application:
- The web application consists of an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` file located in the `Scripter` folder.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the prompter interface.

### How It Works

#### 1. Hardware (Arduino):
- When any button is pressed, the servo rotates 30 degrees, and a message is sent via serial communication to the web application.
- After three button presses, the system resets for the next use.

#### 2. Web Application:
- The prompter displays real-time feedback as the speaker gives their presentation.
- Upon receiving serial communication from the Arduino hardware, supportive messages are displayed on the prompter to boost the speakerâ€™s confidence.

### File Structure
- **Arduino_Codebase.ino**: Arduino code responsible for reading button presses and controlling the servo motor.
- **Scripter Folder**:
  - `.vscode`: Settings for the development environment.
  - `image`: Contains any images/icons used for encouragement.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web-based prompter.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript file that handles the communication between the Arduino and the prompter.
  - `styles.css`: Styling for the prompter interface.
